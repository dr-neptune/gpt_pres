    - Developing an Action Plan
      (Tree of Thoughts prompting)

      Suppose that this project got accepted, and imagine four different project management experts are answering this question.
      All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking, then share it with the group.
      Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc.
      If any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they leave.
      The question the experts are trying to solve is:
      What is the optimal action plan for rolling out this risk management
      suite of tools?

Hi GPT4!

I am interested in learning more about the company Sweetgreen from a
fundamentals-based investor point of view. Can you pull Sweetgreen news
from the past week and provide me an overall summary, a sentiment
classification, and whether you think it is worth buying or selling
stock?

- with the API
  GPT can escape the chat interface and be enabled in larger
  programmatic environments. An interesting way to leverage it's
  ability to reason and self-reflect is to have it act as an agent
  attemption to complete a goal
  - autogpt
    Show examples of agents:
    - Agent GPT
      - https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT
    - GPT Engineer
      - https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer

- prompt engineering
  - langchain allows us to chain together prompts and create custom
    "environments" of information within our session
    - https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/quickstart
    - examples include things like making templates, storing
      information in (vector) databases, allowing the models to choose
      from a variety of tools to use to complete a given task (think things like APIs, calculators,
      programs, etc), allowing models to choose different possible
      paths forward for a given problem

  - these models are also very good at the things that traditional
    deep learning models are good at:
    - zero shot answers, few shot answering, text classification,
      sentiment analysis, summarization

  - fine tuning models is a possibility for the open source models
    that are available.
    - Something like GPT is trained on large corpuses of relatively
      public, high quality text from places like wikipedia,
      stackoverflow, and arxiv
    - we can use a custom corpus on other data sources to create a
      subject matter expert. A good example is the experiments that
      bloomberg is carrying out with [[https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/bloomberggpt-50-billion-parameter-llm-tuned-finance/][bloombergGPT]]

- function calling

Function calling is a recently enabled feature

show weather example:
https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates

This will allow us to more tightly integrate these LLMs into our
software.
